*  Analyze vectors with missing data. 

### 4. [Starting with Data](./04-Data_Start.html)  
*  Describe what the `here` package does
*  Read in tibbles
*  Compare `read_csv` to `read.csv`

### 5. [Manipulating Data with dplyr](./05-dplyr.html)  
*  Describe what the dplyr package in R is used for.  
*  Apply common dplyr functions to manipulate data in R.
